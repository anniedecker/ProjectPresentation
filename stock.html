<!--

    So you'd like to know how to use impress.js?

    You've made the first, very important step - you're reading the source code.
    And that's how impress.js presentations are built - with HTML and CSS code.

    Believe me, you need quite decent HTML and CSS skills to be able to use impress.js effectively.
    More importantly, you need to be a designer. There are no default styles or layouts for impress.js presentations.

    You need to design and build it by hand.

    So...

    Would you still like to know how to use impress.js?

            This is an example of step element being scaled.

            Again, we use a `data-` attribute, this time it's `data-scale="4"`, so it means that this
            element will be 4 times larger than the others.
            From presentation and transitions point of view it means, that it will have to be scaled
            down (4 times) to make it back to its correct size.

            This element introduces rotation.

            Notation shouldn't be a surprise. We use `data-rotate="90"` attribute, meaning that this
            element should be rotated by 90 degrees clockwise.

                For our presentation we used <strong>impress.js</strong> <br />
                which was inspired by the idea behind <a href="http://prezi.com">prezi.com</a> <br />

        <!--

            Along with `data-x` and `data-y`, you can define the position on third (Z) axis, with
            `data-z`. In the example below we use `data-z="-3000"` meaning that element should be
            positioned far away from us (by 3000px).

        <div id="tiny" class="step" data-x="2825" data-y="2325" data-z="-3000" data-rotate="300" data-scale="1">

            And the last one shows full power and flexibility of impress.js.

            You can not only position element in 3D, but also rotate it around any axis.
            So this one here will get rotated by -40 degrees (40 degrees anticlockwise) around X axis and
            10 degrees (clockwise) around Y axis.

            You can of course rotate it around Z axis with `data-rotate-z` - it has exactly the same effect
            as `data-rotate` (these two are basically aliases).

        Last, but not least.

        To make all described above really work, you need to include impress.js in the page.
        I strongly encourage to minify it first.

        In here I just include full source of the script to make it more readable.

        You also need to call a `impress().init()` function to initialize impress.js presentation.
        And you should do it in the end of your document. Not only because it's a good practice, but also
        because it should be done when the whole document is ready.
        Of course you can wrap it in any kind of "DOM ready" event, but I was too lazy to do so ;)
